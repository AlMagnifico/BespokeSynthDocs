<div style="display:inline-block;margin-left:50px;">
feed delayed audio back into earlier in the signal chain. use the "feedback out" connector for sending the audio back up the chain, and the primary output connector for sending the resulting audio forward. using feedback can often lead to extreme and difficult-to-control results!<br/><br/>
<b>limit</b>: clip the feedback audio to this range, to avoid issues with feedback blowing out too intensely.<br>
