<div style="display:inline-block;margin-left:50px;">
looping sequence of notes at an interval. pair with a "pulser" module for more interesting step control. hold "shift" to adjust step length.<br/><br/>
<b><</b>: shift the sequence to the left<br>

<b>></b>: shift the sequence to the right<br>

<b>clear</b>: clear all steps<br>

<b>grid</b>: patch a grid in here from a "midicontroller" module<br>

<b>interval</b>: note length<br>

<b>len</b>: randomize the length of each step's note.<br>

<b>len*</b>: length for this column<br>

<b>length</b>: length that the sequence below should play. the overall grid length can be changed by adjusting "gridsteps" in the triangle menu.<br>

<b>loop reset</b>: when sequence loops, reset to here instead. send a "downbeat"-style message from a pulser to restart the sequence from the first step.<br>

<b>notemode</b>: which set of pitches should the rows represent?<br>

<b>octave</b>: octave of the bottom pitch of this sequence<br>

<b>pitch</b>: randomize pitches in the sequence. hold shift to constrain the randomization to only pick roots and fifths.<br>

<b>rand len chance</b>: when clicking the random length button, what is the chance that a step gets changed?<br>

<b>rand len range</b>: when clicking the random length button, how much will the length change?<br>

<b>rand pitch chance</b>: when clicking the random pitch button, what is the chance that a step gets changed?<br>

<b>rand pitch range</b>: when clicking the random pitch button, how far will the pitch change?<br>

<b>rand vel chance</b>: when clicking the random velocity button, what is the chance that a step gets changed?<br>

<b>rand vel density</b>: when clicking the random velocity button, what are the chances that a step should have a note?<br>

<b>tone*</b>: pitch for this column<br>

<b>vel</b>: randomize the velocity of each step's note.<br>

<b>vel*</b>: velocity for this column<br>

<b>x offset</b>: x offset of attached grid controller<br>

<b>y offset</b>: y offset of attached grid controller<br>
