loop input audio. use with a "looperrecorder" for full functionality.<br/><br/>
<b> m </b>: take the contents of this looper and merge it into another. click this button on the merge source, then on the merge target.<br>

<b>.5x</b>: make loop play at half speed<br>

<b>2x</b>: make loop play at double speed<br>

<b>auto</b>: should pitch shift auto-adjust as the transport tempo adjusts?<br>

<b>b</b>: bake current volume into waveform<br>

<b>capture</b>: when the next loop begins, record input for the duration of the loop<br>

<b>clear</b>: clear the loop audio<br>

<b>commit</b>: commit the current looperrecorder buffer to this loop<br>

<b>copy</b>: take the contents of this looper and copy it onto another. click this button on the copy source, then on the copy target.<br>

<b>decay</b>: amount to lower volume each loop<br>

<b>fourtet</b>: use a textural trick I saw four tet illustrate in a video once: slice the audio into chunks, and for each chunk it at double speed followed by playing it in reverse at double speed. this slider adjusts the mix between the original audio and this "fourtetified" audio.<br>

<b>fourtetslices</b>: chunk size to use for "fourtet" effect<br>

<b>mute</b>: silence this looper<br>

<b>num bars</b>: loop length in measures<br>

<b>offset</b>: amount to offset looper's playhead from transport position<br>

<b>pitch</b>: amount to pitch shift looper output<br>

<b>resample for tempo</b>: this button appears when the current global tempo no longer matches the tempo that the buffer was recorded at. click this to resample the buffer to match the new tempo.<br>

<b>save</b>: save this loop to a wav file<br>

<b>scr</b>: allow loop to be scrached by adjusting "scrspd"<br>

<b>scrspd</b>: playback speed, used with "scr" is enabled. modulate quickly for a vinyl-like scratching effect.<br>

<b>set</b>: shift the contents of the looper so the current offset is the start of the buffer<br>

<b>swap</b>: swap the contents of this looper and with another. click this button on two loopers to swap them.<br>

<b>undo</b>: undo last loop commit<br>

<b>volume</b>: output volume<br>

<b>write</b>: write input audio to loop buffer<br>
