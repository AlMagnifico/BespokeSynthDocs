command center to manage recording into multiple loopers, and allow retroactive loop capture (i.e., always-on recording)<br/><br/>
<b>.5tempo</b>: halve global transport tempo, while keeping connected loopers sounding the same<br>

<b>1</b>: capture the last measure to the currently-targeted looper<br>

<b>2</b>: capture the last 2 measures to the currently-targeted looper<br>

<b>2xtempo</b>: double global transport tempo, while keeping connected loopers sounding the same<br>

<b>4</b>: capture the last 4 measures to the currently-targeted looper<br>

<b>8</b>: capture the last 8 measures to the currently-targeted looper<br>

<b>cancel free rec</b>: if "free rec" is enabled, cancel recording without setting the loop length<br>

<b>clear</b>: clear the recorded buffer<br>

<b>free rec</b>: enable to start recording a loop with no predetermined length. disable to end recording, adjust global transport to match the loop length, and switch the recorder's mode to "loop"<br>

<b>length</b>: length in measures to use when connected loopers use the "commit" button<br>

<b>mode</b>: recorder mode: use "record" to record input and allow it to be committed to buffers when you're ready to loop, use "overdub" to record input and play the loop at our specified length, and use "loop" to play the current loop without adding input<br>

<b>orig speed</b>: reset looper to tempo that loops were recorded at<br>

<b>resample</b>: resample all connected loopers to new tempo<br>

<b>resample & set key</b>: snap tempo to nearest value that matches a key (based upon the current key and the tempo change), resample all connected loopers to that new tempo, and change global scale to the new key<br>

<b>snap to pitch</b>: snap tempo to nearest value that matches a key<br>

<b>target</b>: looper to commit audio to when using the on-buffer capture buttons to the left<br>
