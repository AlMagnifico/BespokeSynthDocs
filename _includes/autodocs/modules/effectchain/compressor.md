try to keep volume at a certain level<br/><br/>
<b>attack</b>: speed to apply gain reduction<br>

<b>lookahead</b>: how much time to "look ahead" to adjust the compression envelope. this necessarily introduces a delay into your output, which could be compensated for by running sequencers slightly early.<br>

<b>mix</b>: amount of compression. lower this value for a "parallel compression" effect. you should use this mix slider instead of the effectchain's mix slider, to compensate for lookahead.<br>

<b>output</b>: makeup gain, to increase volume<br>

<b>ratio</b>: how much gain reduction to apply when the single passes the threshold<br>

<b>release</b>: speed to remove gain reduction<br>

<b>threshold</b>: threshold where gain should start to be reduced<br>
