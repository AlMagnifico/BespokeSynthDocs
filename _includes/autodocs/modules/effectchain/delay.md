echoing delay<br/><br/>
<b>amount</b>: amount of delay that returns<br>

<b>delay</b>: delay in milliseconds<br>

<b>dry</b>: should the dry signal pass through, or just the delayed signal?<br>

<b>feedback</b>: should the output audio feed back into the delay?<br>

<b>input</b>: should we accept input into the delay?<br>

<b>interval</b>: sets delay length to a musical duration<br>

<b>invert</b>: should the delayed audio have its signal inverted? this can give a different sound, and also cancel out DC offset to prevent it from accumulating with feedback.<br>

<b>short</b>: shortcut to shrink the range of the delay slider, to allow for audible-rate delays and comb filter sounds<br>
